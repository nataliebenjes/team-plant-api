## Project Description_
* _User Input: Users can enter an amount in U.S. dollars and select a target currency.

* _Currency Conversion: Upon submitting the form, the application should display the converted amount in the chosen currency out of 5 currency options. For example, if the user enters 10 dollars, the equivalent amount in the selected currency should be shown.

* _Error Handling: If an API call results in an error (status other than 200 OK), the application notifies the user about the specific error on the screen.

* _Currency Validation: If the chosen currency is not available for conversion, the application should notifies the user that the currency does not exist.

### Project Setup
